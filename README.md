This is a physics simulation experiment in haskell. 
The aspiration is that simulations can be run in any number of dimensions and the force intereactions between particles can take any form.

Running:
1. Install stack https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/
2. "stack run"

Should output the position of some particles per time step (using as much of your cpu as its given)
